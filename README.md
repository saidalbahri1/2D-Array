# 2D-Array
User defined 2D array to find the middle element and find its immediate neighbors. Then check those neighbors if they are multiples of 6. If yes, put those integers in 1D array.

For example, the following image is a 2D array. The middle element is 5.

The element 5 has 8 neighbours, as follows: 
[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]

We will check those elements if they are multiples of the middle element, 5. If they are, we will add them to a new 1D array and display them.
